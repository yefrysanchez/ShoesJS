          <h1>Made For The Court</h1>
          <p>
            The Nike Dunk High was released in 1985. It was originally crafted
            as a high top basketball sneaker. The Nike Dunk High was similar to
            other Nike designs of the era – like the Air Force 1 and the Air
            Jordan 1. The marketing behind the Dunk High was unique for Nike.
            Nike used the slogan “Be True To Your School” for advertisements.
            The Dunk was conceived conceptually as a shoe that could be worn by
            college basketball teams and their fans. Nike had deals in place at
            the time with the University of Iowa, University of Kentucky,
            University of Michigan, Georgetown, St. John’s, UNLV, and Syracuse.
            These collegiate powerhouse schools all embraced the Nike Dunk as
            its team shoes. Each school received a pair of Nike Dunks that
            utilized their team colors.

          <h1>Embraced For Skate</h1>
          <p>
            Skaters fell in love with the Nike Dunk High as soon as the public
            fell out of love with them. The rebellious nature of skaters,
            especially in the 1990s, kept them from embracing the popular or
            trendy Nike sneakers. In the early 90s skaters could pick up a pair
            of Nike Dunks for cheap. The shoes also offered the support and
            durability skaters were looking for. The fact that most consumers
            were no longer interested in Nike Dunks, was a major appeal to
            skateboarders.

          <h1>The Birth Of Nike SB</h1>
          <p>
            In 1999 Nike introduced the Dunk Low Pro B and Dunk Low CO.JP
            models. The styles were available in the West Coast and in Japan.
            The Dunks were being used as a regional experiment. The Dunk Low Pro
            B and Dunk Low CO.JP models utilized premium materials, textures,
            colors, and design. As the Dunk grew in popularity during the late
            90s, the internet started to play a prominent role in sneaker news
            and hype. The regionally exclusive Dunks were becoming a trend and
            hot topic on sneaker websites and forums. The internet was
            connecting sneakerheads across the globe, and the Dunk was a major
            focus of their discourse.
